# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
Create a webpage that will include all four of the hemisphere images. We will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, and use a web application to display the data.

The module has three deleverables:
Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

## Resources
Software: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, ChromeDriverManager, Flask, PyMongo, MongoDB, HTML5, Bootstrap 3
Websites: https://marshemispheres.com, https://data-class-mars.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, I will scrape full-resolution images of Mars’ hemispheres and the titles of those images.

## Deliverable 2: Using MongoDB and Flask to display the data as HTML/CSS
Using the MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape, and then a web application was created with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
Copied and updated the Jupyter Notebook Mission to Mars Challenge file to a Python code. Some edits were needed to be changed to match other files and to get programs to run harmoniously.
